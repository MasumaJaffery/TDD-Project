# TDD-Project
TDD is the Test Driven Development Technology that is about writing tests before writing code; if the code does not run according to the test case, then refactor the code. In other words:
# Flow Chart
Write Test => Write Code =>  Run Test =>  If Fails => Refactor Code => Run Test => Repeat Process of Refactor until Test Passed! 
# Main Points 
1. Write the Test Case first.
2. Write the Code in accordance with the Test Case.
3. Run the Test Case and Refactor if the Test Case Failed!
