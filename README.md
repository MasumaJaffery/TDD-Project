# TDD-Project
TDD is the Test Driven Development Technology that is about write tests before write a code and if code does not run according to test case then refactor code. In other words:  Write Test => Write Code =>  Run Test =>  If Fails => Refactor Code => Run Test => Repeat Process of Refactor until Test Passed!
